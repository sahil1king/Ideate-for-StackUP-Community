#Idea for StackUP platform

**Existing issue on platform** -- Currently we have to go all the way down on **my progress** to check under review quests which is
quite time-consuming and irritating sometimes.

This is the bottom of my quests records and to reach here it takes time and multiple clicks to load more.




**Solution** -- We can either turn the past quests upside down so that the recently ended or under review quest becomes visible on
top
of the page under the ongoing quests instead of old quests or we can add a section in **AT a glance** just like submitted and rewarded which shows us the number of under reviewing quests **Or** maybe we can do both.

**Impact** -- This can save users time, will be a good step towards user interface as well and the website will become user
friendly so that users 
don't hesitate to check their quests which are under review. By clicking on **my progress** they can check instantly that how
many of their quests are under review and which ones.
