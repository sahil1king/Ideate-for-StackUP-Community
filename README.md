# Idea for StackUP platform

**Existing issue on platform** --
Currently, we have to scroll down in **my progress** to check quests that are under review, which is quite time-consuming and irritating, and while scrolling down to the bottom
of the page, we face some blank space between two quests which is unknown.

**1** The image displayed above is the bottom of my quest records; reaching here takes time and multiple clicks to load more.

**2** The image displayed above is the screenshot of the blank area found between the quests in the quests history section.

**Solution** --
We can either invert the order of past quests so that the most recent under-review quest is visible at the top of the page under the ongoing quests, or we can add a section in
**At a Glance** (similar to submitted and rewarded) showing the number of quests under review. Perhaps we can do both, and doing this can make the User interface look more
effective and good-looking at the same time.

**Impact** --
Implementing this change can save users time, improve the user interface, and make the website more user-friendly. Users will not hesitate to check their quests under review, as they can instantly see how many of their quests are under review and which ones by clicking on **my progress**.
